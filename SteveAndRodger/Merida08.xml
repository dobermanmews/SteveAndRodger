We visited Merida (Yucatan State, Mexico) for a long weekend in 
    February 2008. Its was a nice break from the dreary Seattle winter. The town 
    of Merida is the capital of Yucatan state. We got there by flying to Cancun 
    and driving about 3 hours west. The cathedral in Merida dates from the 1500s 
    and was constructed from the material of an existing Mayan pyramid. In front 
    of the cathedral is the town square. Most nights, and especially Sunday, the 
    entire town seems to turn out in the square. There are musicians, street 
    artists, food booths and vendors all over the place. Its quite a scene. For 
    some reason, Sunday is the biggest night, and the festivities go on late in 
    to the night. Of course, we didn't take any pictures of Merida itself. One 
    day we took a side trip to Celestun bio-reserve. In Celestun, you get a 
    small boat and ride it out to see the birds -- especially the large flock of 
    flamingoes that live in the lagoon. Pictures of birds we have...commarants, 
    herons, and, of course, the flamingoes.
