Here's a house we passed along the way. Its got the very simple "box with a gable roof" style we're sort of looking for. It seems a bit too plain though. I think there are too few windows with boring trim. I'm not crazy about the different siding choices, although I think Steve likes that more than I do.

This is sort of random...but we saw this barn. I really liked it. The covered "porch" gives it the "saltbox" shape I like. It has a popup of some sort on the other side that I actually would not prefer...I'd rather have the simple gable, but the dormers are OK.

We really liked this design. It made me think some sort of a shed roof with celestory windows would be great for the ADU at Coyle. The front porch would face to the south so the celestories would catch the sun.

This design was a bit plain for us. The siding seems indistinct. I'm also not crazy about the large series of picture windows, although I realize the view is there. I like windows with divisions of some sort in them. I'm also attracted to stronger pitch gables. This would be about a minimum for me.
