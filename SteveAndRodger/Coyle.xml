is a property we purchased in Quilcene WA on January 11, 2010.  The property is just under 50 acres. About 1 1/4 acres of the property is identified as a building site, the rest is a "conservation zone" (CZ), meaning it has a conservation easement on it owned by the

(JLT).

The East Fork of Tarboo Creek and several small tributaries flow across the property shortly before flowing into Tarboo Creek and emptying into Dabob Bay of Hood Canal. The main purpose of the conservation easement is to protect the Tarboo Creek watershed and restore salmon runs.

The building site had a 1920s house and barn on it when we bought it. Unfortunately, both were tear downs.
