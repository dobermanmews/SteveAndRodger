We visited Scotland in March of 2004. The weather for most 
    of the trip was very 'Scottish', rather cold and wet. Of course, it was 
    March, so we did expect it.

We started in Edinburgh. The castle is the centerpiece 
        of the town.

Of course, I also had to see the botanical garden. 
        Although the weather wasn't the greatest, things were just starting to 
        bloom.

After Edinburgh, we headed out into the countryside. We 
        stayed near Fort William, just south of Loch Ness. From there we 
        explored around the loch and up to Inverness. The Scottish country side 
        is like what you hear - a lot of open 'heaths'. The snow covered peak is 
        Ben Nevis, highest point in Scotland at a 'towering' 4406 feet.

Urquhart Castle on the shores of Loch Ness. It's been 
        there since the Middle Ages. The best part - being March we had the 
        place almost to ourselves. During summer, the place would be mobbed.

There's a lot of good hiking in Scotland. This was on a 
        hike just outside Fort William. You hike up into a valley. This was in a 
        cut, just before getting into the valley.

We met this guy and his friends on the way back from the 
        hike. I guess even the cows need good fur for the Scottish winters.
