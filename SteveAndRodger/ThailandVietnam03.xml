We visited Thailand and Vietnam in November 2003. We started 
    in Bangkok and the surrounding area, then flew to Hanoi. We spend a couple 
    days in Hanoi and a couple days on Cat Ba island in Hulang Bay. After that, 
    we transited back through Bangkok and flew on to Phuket. We didn't actually 
    go to Phuket, however. Instead, we headed to the interior of the peninsula 
    to Khao Sok National Park.

Bangkok is a huge city. One of the well known sights is 
        the Reclining Buddha. Its huge.

North of Bankok, Ayuthaya served as the Siamese royal 
        capital from the 14th to 18th century. It must have been a splendid 
        city.

Hanoi was a fascinating city. It was like taking a step 
        back in time. Need a metalworker? You'd find the street with the 
        metalworkers - all banging away against anvils. Much of the 
        work in Vietnam was still manual labor. It was changing fast though, and 
        signs of industrialization and modernization were everywhere.

Hulang Bay is the area of Vietnam with all the really 
        cool limestone rocks structures in the bay. You see Hulang Bay in a lot 
        of movies. It really is fascinating. We took a "private" boat out to Cat 
        Ba island. It turned out to be a boat that could take about 40 people 
        and had a crew of 3. We had the boat to ourselves. It was a great trip 
        out to the island.

On Cat Ba, in addition to doing some hiking, we visited 
        a cave used by the Viet Cong during the war as a field hospital. The 
        overseer was an ex-soldier very proud of his military service. He 
        sang some patriotic Viet Cong songs for us. A bit awkward politically, 
        but he really was a nice guy.

A lot of fisherman actually live on floating homes on 
        Hulang Bay.

After returning from Vietnam, we headed to Khao Sok 
        National Park in Thailand. Its a beautiful area of limestone mountains, 
        rivers, forest and a large man-made lake. We stayed in a treehouse B and B for a 
        couple nights, and stayed on a floating lodge on the lake the last 
        night. The floating lodge was great - small, simple bamboo huts built on 
        oil drums. We were the only ones at the lodge the night we stayed. It 
        was very remote and very peaceful. You could here the gibbons in the 
        morning.

Khao Sok was a great place for hiking. We did one hike 
        to some caves and underground river. We had a guide which was good -- 
        there really wasn't a trail. To start off, the trail was simply the 
        river. We just waded upstream.
