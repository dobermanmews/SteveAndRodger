We visited Costa Rica in November 2004. We started in San 
    Jose. After a couple days there, we rented a car and drove up to the Arenal 
    volcano, then down to the coast at Samara before returning to San Jose for 
    the trip home. San Jose wasn't all that interesting, except for the 
    earthquake in the middle of the first night we were there. Nothing like 
    waking up in the middle of the night wondering if they require reinforced 
    concrete in Costa Rica.

The Arenal volcano is surrounded by cloud 
        forest. There's a  nice lodge on a ridge near the volcano with expansive views of the surrounding valleys and lake. 
        Of course, you can also view the volcano if the clouds clear.

Unfortunately, the clouds never did clear 
        for us, so we never saw the summit. Most of the time, it looked more 
        like this. Although we 
        heard some distant rumbling during our stay, Arenal wasn't very active 
        at the time.

We stopped for a hike at Barra Honda 
        National Park on our way from Arenal to the coast. We found this iguana 
        basking in the sun near the parking lot.

At Barra Honda, we also found a group of monkeys in the trees.

We stayed at a B and B called Las Divas in 
        Samara. Its run by two women, an American and a German. It's right on 
        the beach. The road to Samara was only paved a year to two before we 
        visited, so Samara was still a small surfing town, but it was growing 
        quickly.

From Samara, we drove north along the 
        unpaved roads (and almost lost our 4 wheel drive Dahaitsu rental car in 
        the middle of a river we had to cross) to get to a beach where the baby 
        turtles were hatching.

Once the baby turtles dig themselves out, 
        they run for the water, trying to avoid the birds that gather to feast 
        on baby turtle.
