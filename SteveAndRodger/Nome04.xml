We had free tickets on Alaska Airlines in 2004. So where to 
    use them? Steve was skeptical of my plans to visit Nome to look for wild 
    musk-ox, but I finally convinced him. We visited in July, a great time to 
    see Nome. Being just a little south of the Arctic Circle, there was 
    certainly no shortage of daylight.

Just outside Nome, there are remnants of a train to 
        nowhere. It's the wreckage of an ill-fated attempt to build a railroad 
        serving Nome. The tundra and weather did the project in.

Roads lead about 70 miles outside of Nome to small 
        villages, but don't go any further. There's no way to make it to Nome 
        via a land route - everything comes by air or boat.

The countryside around Nome is mainly untouched tundra. 
        Its beautiful if don't mind the lack of trees.

We came across this fox while exploring the roads 
        outside Nome.

We spend several days driving around looking for musk-ox 
        without luck. Before we left on the last day, we took one more drive. We 
        found a bunch of birders parked by the side of the road pointing at the 
        bushes...yes, there it was, a musk-ox! My trip to Nome was complete!
